# Vehicle Detection and Speed Limit Prediction Using Haar Cascade

## Project Description

This project uses **OpenCV** and **Haar Cascade Classifiers** to detect vehicles and calculate their speed in real-time. It provides an efficient, cost-effective solution for monitoring traffic and enforcing speed limits, with potential for expansion to detect other traffic violations.

# Requirements

* Python 3.x
* Libraries:
  * **OpenCV** (for Haar Cascade-based object detection and video processing)
  * **Numpy** (for numerical operations)
  * **Matplotlib** (for visualizations)
  * **Scikit-learn** (optional, for machine learning models)
